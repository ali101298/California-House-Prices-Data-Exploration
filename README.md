# House Prices Prediction

In this project, I explore and predict California house prices based on `cali_housing.csv` data, using Python in Jupiter Notebook. The tools used for data processing and visualization are Pandas, Seaborn, and MatplotLib. For Data modeling, I performed Linear Regressing using the LinearRegression module from scikit-Learn library.
